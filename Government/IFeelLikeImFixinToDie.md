### The Vietnam war

The whole song talks about how the war is unneccesary and people are dying for no reason. The whole song talks about the war and without the war, the song wouldn't exist.

### Lyrics

The first stanza shows that people try to make war seem like its not bad so they will join. This is obviously wrong as war is not fun and is very deadly. 

The second stanza, which is repeated throughout the song, basically says that the soldiers don't really care why they are fighting and that they are just doing what they're told. 

The third stanza shows that the generals want recognition and then goes on to say that the best was to get peace is by not being peaceful. 

The fifth stanza talks about how war is good for money and implies that wall street doesn't care about the people dying and onl wants money. 

The seventh stanza targets the mothers of the men going to war and how they are willingly sending their sons off to die. 

The song is obviously a satire about the asinine nature of the vietnam war while using surprising tactics to grab people's attention so they might change their mind about the war.
